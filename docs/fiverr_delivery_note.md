Hi pomodorozhong,
 
Here is your delivery. I've processed the generated barcode image through tensorflow to read the width of bars. So now you can even modify the script to use your own PNG image to generate the width.
 
As you've requested, i'm using a pre-build package 'python-barcode' for generating barcodes from data. while working with this package I noticed a slight bug, which I've reported to the author as well. Hopefully they will get it fix soon.
Though you can easily modify that as well from the script.
 
\- follow setup.pdf for a guide on how to run the script.
 
Thanks again for your order! Your delivery is enclosed. If there are any problems, please let me know. I'll get back to you as soon as I can.
 
Thanks again and have a great day! :)

Hey there,
 
I hope you've been well. I've updated the code, so we don't need to use tensorflow anymore. Since I'm more comfortable with tensorflow, I naturally used that. Though turns out we could manipulate the dependency already installed to work around it. So you don't need to import anything extra.
 
Also, I'm sorry I've been a bit under the weather lately, so couldn't update you sooner.
 
Thank you for stopping by, it was really fun working on your project:)
Stay Safe,
 
Best regards,
Yousra
